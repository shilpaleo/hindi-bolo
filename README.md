# hindi-bolo :woman_teacher:
This started as an idea - I wanted to create a fun and engaging way for my toddler to boost her confidence in speaking the Indian language, Hindi. 
I prompted ChatGPT for ideas to start building something simple using Python. 

Since its birth on Singapore's national day, 9 Aug 2024, my `Streamlit` app has evolved to include many features with the aim to cover activities that are fun and engaging for toddlers to learn Hindi. It has my kid hooked! So, yay! :sunglasses:

Hope to keep improving the app and adding more enhancements to build on its functionality.
