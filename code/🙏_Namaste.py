    The above translates to "Welcome to Hindi Bolo". Hindi Bolo is a hobby project app created by a mummy to find fun ways to engage my kid in conversing in Hindi, the Indian language. I found this a fun way for myself, too, to apply my data science knowledge to help with my kid's education. 
    
    This app intends to include and continuously expand on various activities inspired by Singapore Hindi school curriculum for Primary kids.
